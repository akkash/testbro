- `ScreenshotService` - Screenshot capture and management
- WebSocket integration for real-time updates

### Component Architecture
- **Modular Design**: Each component is self-contained and reusable
- **TypeScript**: Full type safety with comprehensive interfaces
- **UI Components**: Built using shadcn/ui component library
- **Responsive**: Mobile-friendly design with adaptive layouts
- **Accessibility**: ARIA labels and keyboard navigation support

### State Management

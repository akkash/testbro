# TestBro Frontend UX Analysis Requirements

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for conducting a comprehensive UX analysis of the TestBro.ai frontend application. The analysis will focus on identifying usability issues, accessibility gaps, performance bottlenecks, and inconsistencies that could impact user experience and business metrics. The goal is to provide actionable recommendations with code examples and A/B testing scenarios to improve user engagement, reduce drop-off rates, and enhance overall product usability.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Clarity and Information Architecture Analysis

**User Story:** As a UX analyst, I want to evaluate the clarity of information presentation and navigation structure, so that I can identify areas where users might experience confusion or cognitive overload.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing the dashboard interface THEN the system SHALL identify information density issues and unclear visual hierarchies
2. WHEN evaluating navigation patterns THEN the system SHALL assess the discoverability of key features and user flows
3. WHEN reviewing content presentation THEN the system SHALL identify inconsistent terminology, unclear labels, and missing contextual information
4. WHEN examining user onboarding flows THEN the system SHALL evaluate the clarity of instructions and progressive disclosure patterns

### Requirement 2: Accessibility Compliance Assessment

**User Story:** As a UX analyst, I want to audit the application for accessibility compliance, so that I can ensure the product is usable by people with disabilities and meets WCAG guidelines.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing form components THEN the system SHALL verify proper ARIA labels, focus management, and keyboard navigation support
2. WHEN evaluating color usage THEN the system SHALL check color contrast ratios and ensure information is not conveyed through color alone
3. WHEN reviewing interactive elements THEN the system SHALL assess focus indicators, touch targets, and screen reader compatibility
4. WHEN examining content structure THEN the system SHALL verify semantic HTML usage and proper heading hierarchies

### Requirement 3: Performance Impact on User Experience

**User Story:** As a UX analyst, I want to identify performance bottlenecks that affect user experience, so that I can recommend optimizations that improve perceived and actual loading times.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing component rendering THEN the system SHALL identify heavy components that cause UI blocking or slow interactions
2. WHEN evaluating data loading patterns THEN the system SHALL assess loading states, error handling, and perceived performance
3. WHEN reviewing asset optimization THEN the system SHALL identify opportunities for code splitting, lazy loading, and bundle optimization
4. WHEN examining real-time features THEN the system SHALL evaluate WebSocket performance and connection handling

### Requirement 4: Design System Consistency Evaluation

**User Story:** As a UX analyst, I want to assess design system consistency across the application, so that I can identify inconsistencies that create cognitive friction for users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing UI components THEN the system SHALL identify inconsistent spacing, typography, and color usage
2. WHEN evaluating interaction patterns THEN the system SHALL assess consistency in button behaviors, form validation, and feedback mechanisms
3. WHEN reviewing component variants THEN the system SHALL identify missing states, inconsistent sizing, and style deviations
4. WHEN examining responsive behavior THEN the system SHALL evaluate consistency across different screen sizes and devices

### Requirement 5: Error Handling and User Feedback Analysis

**User Story:** As a UX analyst, I want to evaluate error handling and user feedback mechanisms, so that I can identify areas where users might become frustrated or lose confidence in the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing error states THEN the system SHALL evaluate error message clarity, recovery options, and prevention strategies
2. WHEN reviewing form validation THEN the system SHALL assess real-time feedback, error positioning, and validation timing
3. WHEN evaluating loading states THEN the system SHALL identify missing or unclear progress indicators and timeout handling
4. WHEN examining success feedback THEN the system SHALL assess confirmation patterns and user confidence building

### Requirement 6: Business Impact Assessment

**User Story:** As a UX analyst, I want to identify UX issues that directly impact business metrics, so that I can prioritize fixes based on potential revenue and conversion impact.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing critical user flows THEN the system SHALL identify friction points that could impact conversion rates
2. WHEN evaluating onboarding experience THEN the system SHALL assess potential drop-off points and user activation barriers
3. WHEN reviewing feature discoverability THEN the system SHALL identify hidden value propositions and underutilized features
4. WHEN examining user engagement patterns THEN the system SHALL assess factors that could impact user retention and satisfaction

### Requirement 7: A/B Testing Recommendations

**User Story:** As a UX analyst, I want to propose specific A/B testing scenarios for identified issues, so that improvements can be validated with real user data before full implementation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN identifying UX issues THEN the system SHALL propose specific A/B test variations with clear hypotheses
2. WHEN recommending tests THEN the system SHALL define success metrics and measurement criteria
3. WHEN prioritizing experiments THEN the system SHALL consider implementation effort versus potential impact
4. WHEN designing test scenarios THEN the system SHALL ensure statistical validity and practical feasibility

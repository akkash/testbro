- `SelectorUpdate`: Selector modification tracking
- `HealingStrategy`: Configurable healing approaches
- `HealingConfiguration`: Project-specific settings
- WebSocket events for real-time healing progress

## Technical Implementation Details

### Adaptation Strategies

1. **Semantic Element Matching**
   - Uses AI to find elements with similar semantic meaning
   - Analyzes element context, role, and interaction patterns
   - Highest confidence threshold (0.8)

2. **Attribute-Based Adaptation**
   - Prioritizes stable attributes (data-testid, id, aria-label)
   - Fallback to less stable attributes (class, role, type)
   - Confidence scoring based on attribute stability

3. **Text Content Matching**
   - Exact and partial text matching
   - Element type combination matching
   - Handles dynamic text with similarity algorithms

4. **AI-Powered Deep Analysis**
   - GPT-4 integration for complex selector generation
   - Context-aware analysis of page structure
   - Fallback strategy for complex cases

### Error Handling and Recovery

1. **Rollback Mechanisms**
   - Complete rollback data stored for every adaptation
   - One-click rollback for failed adaptations
   - Original selector and context preservation

2. **Confidence-Based Decision Making**
   - Automatic application for high-confidence adaptations (>0.8)
   - Manual review required for medium confidence (0.6-0.8)
   - Rejection for low confidence (<0.6)

3. **Fallback Strategies**
   - Multiple adaptation strategies with priority ordering
   - Graceful degradation when strategies fail
   - Human intervention workflow for complex cases

### Performance Optimizations

1. **Database Optimizations**
   - Strategic indexing for fast lookups
   - JSON/JSONB indexing for metadata queries
   - Partitioning for large-scale healing operations

2. **Caching and Memory Management**
   - In-memory caching of active healing sessions
   - Intelligent cleanup of completed sessions
   - Optimized page state capture

3. **Queue-Based Processing**
   - Asynchronous healing execution
   - Priority-based queue management
   - Configurable concurrency limits
